# Computer Vision for Attendance and Emotion Analysis in School Settings. 

# Abstract 
This paper presents facial detection and emotion
analysis software developed by and for secondary students and
teachers. The goal is to provide a tool that reduces the time
teachers spend taking attendance while also collecting data that
improves teaching practices. Disturbing current trends regarding
school shootings motivated the inclusion of emotion recognition
so that teachers are able to better monitor studentsâ€™ emotional
states over time. This will be accomplished by providing teachers
with early warning notifications when a student significantly
deviates in a negative way from their characteristic emotional
profile. This project was designed to save teachers time, help
teachers better address student mental health needs, and motivate
students and teachers to learn more computer science, computer
vision, and machine learning as they use in their own classrooms.
